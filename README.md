# darkpeak package

This package is for use by Robert Smith & Paul Schneider at the University of Sheffield and Dark Peak Analytics.

Functionality:

- Plot themes (for ggplot).
- Colour schemes (for all visuals).
- Commonly used custom functions (e.g. in plots in shiny, and incremental analysis too).
- Markdown templates for reporting results (with header and logo etc).
- Data for teaching (making markov models shiny parameters?).


It takes a lot of time to document the package, so only include things that we will use regularly & to encourage consistency.
